<p><strong>The Security Challenges of Online Voting Have Not Gone Away</strong></p>

<p>One of the disappoints that is continuously brought up in elections, such as the one on November 8th, is the low number of voter turnout. Online voting has been a proposed solution to this problem; however, it is yet to be implemented due to the security difficulties associated with it. When trials were held, hackers were able to change all of the votes in less than two days. Main issues in online voting are vulnerability in the connections between the voter’s’ computer and election servers and the procedural and architectural weaknesses of the security. Online voting must insure correct results and privacy of voters, and it cannot be delayed due to any server attack as voting must be finished in a given timeframe. This is an area of research and development that may lead to a more convenient and efficient voting if implemented properly.</p>
