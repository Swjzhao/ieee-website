<p>Need a leg up on your resume? Curious about how electricity operators control the power systems? Took some entry-level energy/power courses but not sure how they work in the real world? <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://ieee.utoronto.ca/index.html">IEEE UofT Student Branch</a> is collaborating with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://toronto.ieee.ca/category/events/power-energy/">IEEE Toronto Power and Energy Chapter</a> to host a power systems case competition for engineering students, so come learn and build your own energy system!</p>
<p>The competition is designed for <strong>everyone</strong> to participate, from beginners to energy experts! To help facilitate your learning experience, we will be hosting a tutorial before the competition in addition to tutorial and presentation during the event. Our speakers and judges are researchers and industrial professionals from OPG, IESO, and Centre of Urban Energy. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year engineering students are strongly encouraged to attend!</p>
<p>The details of the speakers are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="speakers.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. For those of you in APS112, this competition will also be worth 5 PD points!</strong></p>
<p>Date: March 17 &amp; 18, 2018</p>
<p>Duration: 9:00 am Saturday - 3:00 pm Sunday</p>
<p>Location: Sandford Fleming Building, 10 King's College Rd, Toronto, ON M5S 3G8</p>

<h1 id="faqs">FAQs</h1>
<p><strong>What exactly is the Energy/Power problem that we're trying to solve?</strong></p>
<p>You will be are given a power system and are expected to optimally dispatch the system for 24 hours. In a nutshell, this is an optimization problem given in the context of the Electrical Power System. </p>
<!-- [sneak peak here] -->
<p><strong>When is the Deadline to Register?</strong></p>
<p>The registration deadline is Sunday, March 15th, 2018 (11:59 pm)</p>
<p><strong>Where do I register?</strong></p>
<p>Please register individually on Eventbrite, and then fill out the team information in this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/forms/Nu2lDHuGERVttqHm2">Google Form(One per team)</a></p>
<p><strong>What if I know very little about energy and power - can I still come?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! The competition is designed to allow both beginners to experts to participate. In a nutshell this competition is an optimization problem in the context of Power Systems. To help level the playing field, we will be hosting a crash course on power systems before the competition in addition to a tutorial and presentation during the event. Also, please feel free to ask questions during the competition.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to bring?</strong></p>
