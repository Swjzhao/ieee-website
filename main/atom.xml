&lt;p&gt;Can you believe that September is almost over and October is right around the corner!!? Since preparing Halloween costume is probably the biggest excitement during October, why not try this illuminated costume by Adafruit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The costume is generally built with the touching sensitive Gamma Mo Microcontrollers to perform the animation that’s pre-programmed in full color. These microcontroller which runs CircuitPython are easily embedded under wearable clothes. CircuitPython is the modified Python language specially for embedded devices. What makes this topic further interesting is that Python has not been categorized as embedded language like C/C++, but if this new CircuitPython begins to form the basis of Microcontroller programing, then the “normal” in coding world might be revolutionized in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are interested in building one yourself, there is a full instruction in the original article as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organic solar cells could be sewn into clothes in the near future to power wearable devices. With a steady power supply, wearable devices such as health monitors will be able to continuously collect data. Previously, energy-harvesting textiles were difficult to make because they had to collect energy efficiently, be highly stretchable and be stable in air and water. However, researchers have developed flexible organic solar cells with a high energy conversion efficiency of 7.9 percent that decreased slightly after undergoing extensive water experiments. Further research will be focused on using other materials to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
